Usage:  docker manifest COMMAND

The **docker manifest** command has subcommands for managing image manifests and
manifest lists. A manifest list allows you to use one name to refer to the same image
built for multiple architectures.

To see help for a subcommand, use:

    docker manifest CMD --help

For full details on using docker manifest lists, see the registry v2 specification.
